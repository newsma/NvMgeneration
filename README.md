# NvMgeneration

You need to install mpfr and gmp and possibly update the library location -L.. 

if you have sudo you should be able to install by

sudo apt-get install libmpfr-dev libmpfr-doc libmpfr4 libmpfr4-dbg

These might alread be installed if not you'll have to build form source and update the -L to where you installed them.


This is the original version of Brutus I'll hard code the fix used once you can get to to compile and run.
